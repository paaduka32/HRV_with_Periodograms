# HBV(Heart Beat Variability)_with_Periodograms


## Introduction

This project analyzes ECG signals to evaluate heart health by calculating Power Spectral Density (PSD) using Welch's method. Key metrics such as low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) power bands, along with their LF/HF ratio, are used to distinguish between healthy and abnormal heart conditions.


## Usage

This project helps users gain fundamental knowledge about data analysis techniques like Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis and LF/HF ratio calculation. It also provides insights into distinguishing healthy and abnormal heart conditions.
Please download the relevant ECG data (e.g., from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database) and ensure the file paths in the script match your data's location. The code is generalized and can work with any ECG dataset compatible with the WFDB library.


## Data Sources

The project uses ECG data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. Ensure the data files are formatted for use with the WFDB Python library.

## Results

### LF/HF Ratios:

Healthy hearts typically exhibit a normal LF/HF ratio.
Abnormal hearts show deviations, indicating arrhythmias or weakened heart conditions.

### Visualizations:

PSD plots for each dataset.
Comparisons between healthy and abnormal heart conditions for better insights.
